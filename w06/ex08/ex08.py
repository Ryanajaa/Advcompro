### Assignment 7: Reading from a Text File and Handling Exceptions
**Required Knowledge**: File Handling, with Statement, Exception Handling in Python
**Instructions**:
1. Continue from Assignment 5. Ensure you have the Car class ready with its current functionalities intact.
2. Create a Method: Add a method named read_color_from_file to your Car class. This method will be responsible for reading the car's color from an external file.
3. File Reading: Use a with statement to safely open and read the contents of the color.txt file created in Assignment 6. The file should contain a single word representing the carâ€™s color. To retrieve the content, you can use file.read().strip().
4. Testing: Create a Car object and test the read_color_from_file method by providing the correct path to the color.txt file and ensuring it works as expected.
